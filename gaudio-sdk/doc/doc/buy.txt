[1]: This feature is currently only available when using the DirectSound driver (will be selected automaticly) on Windows platforms.
[2]: MP3 playback is done via a plugin which comes along with irrKlang (and its full source code) so that it is easily possible to remove mp3 support if wished. If you are using mp3 playback in your application, you might need to purchase an mp3 license from Thompson Multimedia as most software using mp3s has to, although there are special prices and conditions for games.
